*#BM491 Repository of BCA(MAKAUT)#*

This repository contains some numerical analysis programs written in c. (no graphical interface included.)
I'll also include the MATLAB programs later. (as IT or CSE students can only use MATLAB in their lab exams of NM)

#*p.s: Regula Falsi, Trapezoidal, Simpson's 1/3 and 3/8 are yet to be included.*#

Feel free to **share** and **starmark** the repository.
